# StifleR
   
StifleR makes your network go faster. It’s that simple if you want to leave it there, but no, you have to know more don’t you..

### What Does It Do?

StifleR makes sure that your users get the content that they need from the most local source to them, in the most efficient way possible, without upsetting the network folks. Basically moving software from A to B like a complete boss is our business. Anywhere in the world.

Be it from the Cloud, local servers, or corporate datacentre, StifleR delivers content reliably over WAN, LAN, Wifi or HiFi (ok not HiFi but you get the idea).

### Why Do We Need It?

Think of it this way. Would you get onto an airplane knowing that there was no Air Traffic Control in place? Nuff said. Without the StifleR your WAN and LAN traffic is ‘flying blind’ and potentially blocking business critical content such as Point-of-Sale data or whatever, with Jimmy in the Mailroom’s Game of Thrones download.

As we say – ‘How to be the Network team’s best friend in 5 minutes or less’

### But How Do You Do It 2Pint?

Well we built  StifleR around some awesome Microsoft tech such as BranchCache, which is a WAN Accelerator that’s been built into Windows for 7 years now. We also use Microsoft SignalR (see what we did with the name there?)  which is a mahooosively scalable platform for real-time comms and all that. Pair all that with the mighty Background Intelligent Transfer Service and you got a marriage made to last.
